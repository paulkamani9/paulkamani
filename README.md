## This repo

- Single-page portfolio application.

## Deployment checklist

1. Update canonical URL and social preview images in `index.html` (`https://paulkamani9.github.io/paulkamani/`).
2. Add a production-ready OG/Twitter preview image at `/public/og-image.jpg` and update the meta tags.
3. Verify `info.md` is not committed (it is added to `.gitignore`).
